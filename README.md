  ## Description
  This project is a command-line application that generates a README file from a user's input. The goal of this application is to help developers create and organize professional README  files. <br>To use this application you will navigate to the command-line and run node index.js. This will run a user through a list of questions. The input from the user will populate under the appropriate sections on the README  file. <br>This project was created to help developers streamline a README file for their projects. A well written and organized README file will allow others to understand and collaborate on projects.
